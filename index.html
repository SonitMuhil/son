                <p class="text-muted text-left">The Vel has a lot to do with one’s mind and knowledge. It is very clear that the Vel is broad, has a sharp edge and is very deep in its length. The breadth represents the broadness of the mind. The sharpness denotes the sharpness of our knowledge. It is also associated with one pointed devotion and ambition.

                    The depth of the Vel simply relates to depth of our thoughts and mind. The iconography of Lord Murugan’s Vel certainly can be taken as a guide by all of us.

                    Our educational endeavour was launched on the auspicious day of Vijayadasami in the year 2010, with a Montessori environment for children of age group 3 to 6 years. As the numbers increased and with the growing reputation, our school is now a full-fledged CBSE affiliated school.

                    Our initiatives are all driven by a set of values which underpin everything we do. Vel is a community in which mutual respect, mutual support and mutual success flourish.</p>

            The school canteen is a great place to promote an enjoyment of healthy eating. For students who use the canteen regularly, the food purchased makes a significant contribution to their total food intake and nutrition; therefore it makes sense to ensure the best food possible is available to enhance their ability to learn and take in the information presented to them in class.

For students who don’t use the canteen regularly, the canteen still plays an important educational and modelling role for healthy eating habits.

There are many aspects of a child’s life that may be restricted in an educational setting. For example: the type of reading material accessed in the library, internet access and visual material (DVD) and the clothes they wear. It is appropriate to restrict unhealthy food in an educational setting. The canteen also plays an important role within the broader school environment – that of reinforcing knowledge, skills and behaviours about healthy eating and lifestyle which are taught in the classroom. Food provided at school has a considerable influence on the development of children’s long-term eating habits, food preferences and attitudes towards food. The school canteen plays a vital role in promoting healthy foods and creating a school culture of healthy eating.

             With the coastal region continuing to receive incessant rainfall, a minor landslip off National Highway 66 near Nanthoor Junction in the city brought down a huge tree on a school bus on Wednesday morning. Fortunately, all 17 children in the bus escaped unhurt, though the bus suffered extensive damage.

The incident occurred when the bus, belonging to Cambridge International School, Neermarga, was ferrying students from Pumpwell side towards the school. As it was nearing Nanthoor Junction, the tree came crashing down on it as well as another vehicle.
